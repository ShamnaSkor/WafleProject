In YC114 each major empire faction, having been embroiled in a harrowing, extensive, long-term war, recognized the growing need for support and logistics functionality in their vessels during the kind of protracted interstellar warfare that might otherwise prove exhausting for its participants. In the Caldari State, this led to the redesign and redeployment of the Bantam.\n\

The Executioner is another newly commissioned ship of the Amarr Imperial Navy. The Executioner was designed specially to counter the small, fast raider frigates of the Minmatar Republic; thus it is different from most Amarr ships in favoring speed over defenses.

In YC114 each major empire faction, having been embroiled in a harrowing, extensive, long-term war, recognized the growing need for support and logistics functionality in their vessels during the kind of protracted interstellar warfare that might otherwise prove exhausting for its participants. In the Amarr Empire, this led to the redesign and redeployment of the Inquisitor.\n\
\n\
The Inquisitor was originally an example of how the Amarr Imperial Navy modeled their design to counter specific tactics employed by the other empires.

  {id:591, n:"Tormentor", mg:72, pmg:5, mta:0, d:"<font size=\"14\"><b>Development</b></font>\n\
The Tormentor has been in service for many decades. For most of that time it saw service as a mining ship, its size barring it from making any kind of impact on the battlefield. As with most Amarr ships, however, its strong defenses always made it a tough opponent to crack, and with recent advances in turret capacitor use and damage output, its lasers have now stopped digging into dead ore and are instead focused on boring through the hulls of hapless vessels in combat.", v: 24398, c: 130, s1: 3331, dc: 10, db: 10, tl: 1, aemr: 0.5, aexr: 0.8, akir: 0.75, athr: 0.65, semr: 1, sexr: 0.5, skir: 0.6, sthr: 0.8, hemr: 1, hexr: 1, hkir: 1, hthr: 1, r: 4, pgo: 50, cpuo: 130, shhp: 400, sshp: 350, sahp: 500, lsc: 4, msc: 3, hsc: 3, tusc: 3, rsc: 3, rgsz: 1, calb: 400, vel: 335},

In YC114 each major empire faction, having been embroiled in a harrowing, extensive, long-term war, recognized the growing need for support and logistics functionality in their vessels during the kind of protracted interstellar warfare that might otherwise prove exhausting for its participants. In the Gallente Federation, this led to the redesign and redeployment of the Navitas.\n\
\n\
The Navitas had been a solid mining vessel that had seen wide use by independent excavators, along with being one of the best ships available for budding traders and even for much-maligned scavengers. After its redesign, its long-range scanners and sturdy outer shell gave way entirely for remote repairing capabilities, moving the Navitas away from the calming buzz of mining lasers and into the roar of battle.", v: 10000, c: 280, s1: 3328, dc: 5, db: 5, tl: 1, aemr: 0.5, aexr: 0.9, akir: 0.65, athr: 0.65, semr: 1, sexr: 0.5, skir: 0.6, sthr: 0.8, hemr: 1, hexr: 1, hkir: 1, hthr: 1, r: 8, pgo: 49, cpuo: 145, shhp: 335, sshp: 250, sahp: 400, lsc: 3, msc: 3, hsc: 3, tusc: 2, rsc: 3, rgsz: 1, calb: 400, vel: 330},

Often nicknamed The Fat Man this nimble little frigate is mainly used by the Federation in escort duties or on short-range patrols. The Tristan has been very popular throughout Gallente space for years because of its versatility.

The Incursus may be found both spearheading and bulwarking Gallente military operations. Its speed makes it excellent for skirmishing duties, while its resilience helps it outlast its opponents on the battlefield. Incursus-class ships move together in groups and can quickly and effectively gang up on ships many times their size and overwhelm them. In recent years the Incursus has increasingly found its way into the hands of pirates, who love its aggressive appearance.

The Punisher is considered by many to be one of the best Amarr frigates in existence.

In YC114 each major empire faction, having been embroiled in a harrowing, extensive, long-term war, recognized the growing need for support and logistics functionality in their vessels during the kind of protracted interstellar warfare that might otherwise prove exhausting for its participants. In the Minmatar Republic, this led to the redesign and redeployment of the Burst.\n\

The Kestrel is a heavy missile boat with one of the most sophisticated sensor arrays around. Interestingly enough, it has been used by both the Caldari Navy and several wealthy trade corporations as a cargo-hauling vessel. It is one of few trading vessels with good punching power, making it ideal for solo trade-runs in dangerous areas.
